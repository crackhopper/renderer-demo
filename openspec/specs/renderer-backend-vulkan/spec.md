The VulkanPipeline SHALL consume a `LX_core::PipelineBuildInfo` (from the `pipeline-build-info` capability) as its single construction input, and SHALL support:

- Creating `VkShaderModule`s from `buildInfo.stages` (bytecode only; no filesystem loads at this layer)
- Building `VkDescriptorSetLayout`s from `buildInfo.bindings` (reflected `ShaderResourceBinding` list) — one layout per distinct `set` number, each layout populated from the `(binding, type, stageFlags)` of every `ShaderResourceBinding` whose `set` matches
- Creating a pipeline layout with the derived descriptor set layouts and the `buildInfo.pushConstant` range
- Defining vertex input state from `buildInfo.vertexLayout`

#### Scenario: Dynamic graphics pipeline creation from PipelineBuildInfo

- Creating VulkanBuffer from IRenderResource with type VertexBuffer or IndexBuffer
- Creating VulkanTexture from IRenderResource with type CombinedImageSampler
- Maintaining map of IRenderResource* to created Vulkan objects
- Initializing render pass with correct formats
- Maintaining a cache of graphics `VulkanPipeline` instances keyed by `LX_core::PipelineKey` (using `PipelineKey::Hash`), creating and storing a pipeline on cache miss from the current draw’s shader and layout data, with no requirement for a fixed built-in pipeline name such as `blinnphong_0`

#### Scenario: Resource mapping for vertex buffer
- **WHEN** initScene creates GPU resource for vertex buffer IRenderResource
- **THEN** VulkanResourceManager SHALL store mapping and return valid VulkanBuffer

#### Scenario: Pipeline lookup by PipelineKey

- **WHEN** draw logic requests the pipeline for a `PipelineKey` already present in the cache

- **THEN** All assertions SHALL pass and Vulkan resources are valid

#### Scenario: Triangle render test passes
- **WHEN** test_vulkan_renderer renders a triangle
- **THEN** Window SHALL display triangle without validation errors or crashes

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: VulkanDevice::initialize() shall return boolean success indicator

**Reason**: Implementation changed to exception-based error handling. Boolean returns were removed in favor of `std::runtime_error` exceptions.

**Migration**: Wrap initialization in try/catch block. Catch `std::exception` for error handling.

### Requirement: VulkanDevice shall have public constructor

**Reason**: Factory pattern enforcement via private Token struct.

**Migration**: Use `VulkanDevice::create()` factory method instead of direct construction.
